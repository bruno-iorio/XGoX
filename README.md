# XGoX [name subject to change]

The Project will be divided into 4 subparts:

## 1) Develop game mechanics

This includes: 

 - Program a basic board;
 - Add game concept and rules;
 - Make it playable locally;
 - Optimize it when all is done (or after).

## 2) Create a simple(no Machine Learning Bot)

Primarily, the idea is to make a simple bot that uses only brute force to compute the next move.
And sugestions, and new ideas are very welcomed.

This part includes:
 - Research of some algorithms (such as Alpha-Beta search algorithm);
 - create a simple, but decent evaluation system;
 - integrate the bot with the game concept.

## 3) Find a good database

We have to find a good database and also to find a way of converting it into inputs that are
compatible with our models.

## 4) Machine Learning

This includes:

- Deciding which methods to use: Supervised or unsupervised / Reinforced Learning
- Deciding algorithms: possibly Neural Networks
- Integrating database
- creating an effient model(very vague, but sets up a minimal goal)

## How we are going to work:
This is a matter to be discussed with the group.
But at the beginning, we may use a pull-request/peer review system.
Minimal instructions are:

- NEVER MERGE TO MAIN 
- Commits must have a minimally descriptive name
- Always work on branches apart from main, unless to edit simple text(not real code) files
- File names should be also descriptive, and always start with capital letters (standartization)
- Create different folders for different programming languages (Name of the folder could be "cpp", for example)
- DO NOT COPY code from other repos (use "git submodule" - [add reference link])
